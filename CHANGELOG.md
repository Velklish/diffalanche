## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository scanner: `scan(root, config)` in `src/core/scanner` walks the
  `roots` of `config.json` to `depth` levels, reports every repository by its
  path relative to the root with its kind — an ordinary repository or a linked
  worktree — and never descends into one, so nested submodules and worktrees
  stay out of the review. `exclude` globs skip directories, symbolic links are
  not followed, and a scan warns about a worktree whose main repository is also
  under the root and about a directory it cannot read. See
  [01-scanner.md](docs/reference/01-scanner.md).
- Package skeleton: `package.json`, strict `tsconfig.json`, Biome, Vitest, the
  `src/core`, `src/cli`, `src/server`, `src/ui`, `scripts`, and `skills`
  directories, and a GitHub Actions workflow running lint, typecheck, and tests.
- `scripts/synth.ts`, the generator of the synthetic review: 21 repositories,
  300 files, 30 000 changed lines, and 200 comments, deterministic for a given
  seed, with a small profile for unit tests. Run it with
  `bun run synth -- --out <dir>`; it refuses an output directory it did not
  write itself, because it erases that directory before filling it.
- Phase 0 spike of the diff rendering: `src/core` reads the change set of every
  repository through the `git` binary, `src/server` serves it as one response on
  Hono, `src/ui` renders it with a diff library in split view, and `perf/`
  measures the page in headless Chromium. `react-diff-view` with virtualisation
  by file card meets the budgets of the specification; see
  [ADR-008](docs/adr/adr-008-diff-rendering-verdict.md).
- Both delivery channels on a CLI with `version`, `serve`, and `--help`:
  `bun run build` produces `dist/cli.js` for npm and six binaries — macOS,
  Linux, and Windows on x64 and arm64 — each carrying the UI inside itself. The
  runtime switch between Bun's server and `@hono/node-server` is the only place
  in `src/` that knows which runtime it runs on.
- `src/core/storage`, the data directory: session directories, the `current`
  pointer — one line naming the session — and reading and writing `review.json`,
  `comments.json`, and `diff.json` as JSON with `version: 1` and two-space
  indentation. Every write is a temporary file, `fsync`, and a rename over the
  target; every write to a session goes through `withLock`, a `.lock` directory
  with a bounded wait and takeover of a lock past the deadline recorded in it.
  A broken file is refused with the file and the field named. The synthetic
  review now writes the `current` pointer too.
- Performance gate: `bun run perf` measures the page on the synthetic review
  three times in headless Chromium and fails when the median of any line of the
  budget table is over budget. It runs in CI as the `perf` job, prints the table
  into the run summary, and is one of the `gates` of `backslop.json`. The two
  budget lines Phase 0 cannot measure — switching sessions and updating after an
  edit — are printed as pending until DA-9 and DA-25.
